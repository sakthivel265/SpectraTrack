        <p>Our IoT Tracking System is an innovative solution designed to provide real-time monitoring and enhanced 
           security for valuable assets. Built around the powerful ESP32-WROOM module for GPS tracking and the ESP32-CAM
           for image capture, the system combines precise location data with visual verification to deliver a comprehensive tracking experience. The core functionality of the system revolves around its ability to pinpoint the exact location of an object while simultaneously capturing images when necessary. This ensures that users not only know where their asset is, but can also see what is happening around it. Whether it is a vehicle, shipment, or personal belonging, the combination of GPS and camera data provides a higher level of situational awareness and security. 
           Data collected by the device is transmitted over the internet, making it accessible from anywhere in the 
           world through intuitive web and mobile interfaces. This ensures constant connectivity and the ability to 
           respond quickly to any movement or security concern. The portability of the device means it can be deployed 
           in various environments without requiring complex installation.</p>
